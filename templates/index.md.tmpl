# RabbitMQ Provider

[RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com) is an AMQP message broker server. The RabbitMQ provider exposes resources used to manage the configuration of resources in a RabbitMQ server.

The [RabbitMQ management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management) must be enabled on the server, to use this provider. You can enable the plugin by doing something similar to:
