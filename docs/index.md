# RabbitMQ Provider

[RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com) is an AMQP message broker server. The RabbitMQ provider exposes resources used to manage the configuration of resources in a RabbitMQ server.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the RabbitMQ provider
provider "rabbitmq" {
  endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:15672"
  username = "guest"
  password = "guest"
}

# Create a virtual host
resource "rabbitmq_vhost" "example" {
  name = "myvhost"
}
```

## Requirements

The [RabbitMQ management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management) must be enabled on the server, to use this provider. You can enable the plugin by doing something similar to:
```sh
$ sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```
